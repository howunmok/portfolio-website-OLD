# My Portfolio Website (Previous Version)

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the previous version of my personal portfolio website. This project was an initial step in showcasing my skills as a Front-end Developer.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site serves as a record of my early stages in web development and design.
